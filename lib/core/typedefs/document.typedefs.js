 * @typedef {Object} Document
 * @property {string} uid - A unique identifier generated by Rize
 * @property {string} document_type - The document type. Only monthly statements are currently available.
 * @property {customer | synthetic_account | custodial_account} scope_type - The type of scope of activities included in the document. If the type is `customer`, 
 * the statement will include all Synthetic and Custodial Accounts associated with the customer in the statement period. 
 * (to be discussed/determined; not implemented) `synthetic_account` and `custodial_account` will include the activities associated with the respective account only.
 * @property {string} period_started_at - The date and time when the document period started at, inclusive
 * @property {string} period_ended_at - The date and time when the document period ended at, exclusive
 * @property {string} created_at - The date and time when the document became available
 * @property {Array<string>} customer_uids - A list of UIDs of Customers that are associated with the document.
 * (not implemented) Note that once we allow joint pool and accounts, this list will be pessimistic; each of the listed
 * Customers should be associated with every account of which activities are included in the statement. Currently as implemented,
 * this list should have exactly one UID.
 * @property {Array<string>} custodial_account_uids - A list of UIDs of Custodial Accounts that are associated with the document.
 * If `scope_type` is `custodial_account`, this list will contain only one UID. In fact, currently as implemented, this list should always have exactly one UID.
 * @property {Array<string>} synthetic_account_uids - A list of UIDs of Synthetic Accounts that are associated with the document.
 * If `scope_type` is `synthetic_account`, this list will contain only one UID.
