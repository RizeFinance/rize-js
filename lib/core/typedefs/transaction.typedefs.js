/**
 * @typedef {Object} Transaction
 * @property {string} uid - A unique identifier generated by Rize
 * @property {number} id - A unique numeric identifier that indicates the order in which the Transactions were created
 * @property {number|null} [settled_index] - A unique index that indicates the order in which the Transactions were settled. Null if status is `queued` or `pending`.
 * @property {number|null} [transfer_uid] - The UID of the Transfer this Transaction is associated with, if any.
 * @property {string} source_synthetic_account_uid - Synthetic Account from where the asset is pulled
 * @property {string} destination_synthetic_account_uid - Synthetic Account where the asset is landed
 * @property {Array<string>} transaction_event_uids - A list of UIDS referring to Transaction Events belonging to this Transaction, if any. 
 * An empty array will be returned if there is no event involved. 
 * The array may contain more values as the Transaction progresses and will no longer grow when its status becomes settled. 
 * The array may still be empty by the time the Transaction is `settled` if there is no custodial asset movement as a result of this Transaction.
 * @property {Array<string>} custodial_account_uids - A list of UIDS referring to Custodial Accounts that are so far invovled in this Transaction. 
 * An empty array will be returned if there is Custodial Account involved. 
 * The array may contain more values as the Transaction progresses and will no longer grow when its status becomes settled. 
 * The array may still be empty by the time the Transaction is `settled` if there is no custodial asset movement as a result of this Transaction.
 * @property {'queued'|'pending'|'settled'|'failed'} status - When a Transfer is created via `transfers.init()`, an associated Transaction is created with queued status. 
 * If it involves at least one custodial transfer, once the custodial transfer is initiated, the status will transition to pending.
 * 
 * Once a Transaction is settled, whether it has asset movement in custodial level, or is synthetic-only, or is RDFI (no Transfer associated), it will have a settled status.
 * 
 * - ***queued*** - The Transaction is being prepared as a result of a Transfer request. Transactions that originate outside of Rize (e.g., debit card transactions, RDFI ACHs, direct deposits, etc.) will not be given this status.
 * - ***pending*** - The Transaction is being processed. This state will persist until all related Transaction Events have settled or could not be completed.
 * - ***settled*** - The Transaction is complete. All of the related Transaction Events are settled.
 * - ***failed*** - The Transaction has failed. This state indicates that one of the related Transaction Events could not be settled. A failed Transaction may require the reversal of a related Synthetic Line Item and/or Custodial Line Item.
 * @property {string} us_dollar_amount - The amount will never be negative
 * @property {'atm_withdrawal'|'card_purchase'|'card_refund'|'dispute'|'external_transfer'|'fee'|'internal_transfer'|'other'|'reversed_transfer'|'third_party_transfer'} type
 * - ***atm_withdrawal*** - Cash is withdrawn at an ATM using a Debit Card.
 * - ***card_purchase*** - A purchase is made using a Debit Card.
 * - ***card_refund*** - A previous Debit Card Transaction is refunded.
 * - ***dispute*** - If a Customer claims that a Transaction was created in error, one or more Transactions will be created with this type to credit or debit based on the dispute outcome.
 * - ***external_transfer*** - This Transaction originates from a Transfer to or from an external Synthetic Account.
 * - ***fee*** - A fee charged to the account. This includes ACH reversals and Debit Card ATM fees.
 * - ***internal_transfer*** - The Transaction originates from a Transfer between two Synthetic Accounts that are not of type external.
 * - ***other*** - Miscellaneous Transactions, such as write-offs.
 * - ***reversed_transfer*** - A previous Transfer is reversed; when a Transfer is reversed, the type of the original Transaction will be `external_transfer`, `internal_transfer`, or `third_party_transfer`.
 * - ***third_party_transfer*** - The Transaction was initiated from an external source. This will likely be an RDFI ACH, where an external source initiates a withdrawal from or deposit to the account.
 * @property {'positive'|'negative'|'neutral'} net_asset - Indicates whether the Customer's asset has gone up (`positive`), gone down (`negative`) or stayed the same (`neutral`) as a result of this Transaction.
 * @property {string} description
 * @property {string} created_at - The date and time when the Transaction is first recognized by Rize. This may be when the Transfer is initiated if the Transaction is associated with one.
 * @property {string} settled_at - The date and time when the Transaction is settled.
