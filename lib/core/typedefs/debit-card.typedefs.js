 * @typedef {Object} DebitCard
 * @property {string} uid - A unique identifier generated by Rize
 * @property {string} external_uid - A unique identifier Client supplies. It should be given when creating a new resource and must be unique within the resource type. If the same value is given, no new resource will be created.
 * @property {string} customer_uid - A UID referring to the Customer who owns this Card.
 * @property {string} pool_uid - A UID referring to the Pool to which this Card belongs.
 * @property {string} synthetic_account_uid - A UID referring to the specific Synthetic Account to which this Card belongs. Any debit or credit transactions from this Card will occur in this account.
 * @property {string} custodial_account_uid - A UID referring to the specific Custodial Account to which this Card belongs. Any debit or credit transactions from this Card will occur in this account.
 * @property {string|null} [card_last_four_digits] - Last 4 digits of the Debit Card number to aid in indentifying the Card. Null if the Card is not yet issued (i.e. status is `initiated`).
 * @property {'queued'|'issued'|'printing_physical_card'|'printing_physical_card_replacement'|'shipped'|'card_replacement_shipped'|'usable_without_pin'|'normal'|'closed'|'damaged'|'lost'|'stolen'|'administrative_lock'|'closed_by_administrator'|'shipment_returned'|'card_replacement_shipment_returned'} status
 * A value indicating the current status for this Card. Some of these are subject to change, and additional statuses may be added.
 * - ***queued*** - This is the first state a debit card will enter. This status indicates that a create request has been submitted successfully from the Client and is queued to be issued. A debit card will be in this state for a very short (less than one second) period of time.
 * - ***issued*** - This is the second state a requested debit card will enter. An Issued debit card has been assigned a PIN, PAN, CVV, and expiration and these details are submitted to a card printer for physical card production. The last 4 digits of the card are available once this status is reached.
 * - ***printing_physical_card*** - The physical Card is being produced. This status applies only to new physical cards; the corresponding status for replacement cards is `printing_physical_card_replacement`
 * - ***printing_physical_card_replacement*** - The physical Card is being produced. This status applies only to replacement physical Cards with the same PAN; the corresponding status for new Cards is `printing_physical_card`
 * - ***shipped*** - The Card has been shipped. This status applies only to new physical Cards; the corresponding status for replacement Cards is `card_replacement_shipped`
 * - ***card_replacement_shipped*** - The Card has been shipped. This status applies only to replacement physical Cards with the same PAN; the corresponding status for new Cards is `shipped`
 * - ***usable_without_pin*** - The Card has been activated but the PIN has not been set. If activated via IVR, the Card will stay in this status for just a brief moment before moving on to the `normal` status.
 * - ***normal*** - The Card has been activated and the PIN is set via IVR. The Card is ready to use.
 * - ***closed*** - The Card is closed and can no longer be used. When the Customer gets archived, the Card will also be closed. If a Card can no longer be in use for other reasons, such as due to returned shipment, the Card may have a different status that also indicates that the Card is closed.
 * - ***damaged*** - The Card has been damaged. The Card will continue to be usable while the new physical card is being produced and shipped. See the `debitCard.reissue` function for guidance on how to reissue a debit card.
 * - ***lost*** - The Card is reported lost and the Card is considered closed. See the `debitCard.reissue` function for guidance on how to reissue a debit card.
 * - ***stolen*** - The Card is reported stolen. This status indicates that the Card is closed and no longer available for use. See the `debitCard.reissue` function for guidance on how to reissue a debit card.
 * - ***administrative_lock*** - A Program Administrator from the Custodial Partner or the Rize Team have issued a Card lock. The Client cannot unlock the Card through the API or the Rize Administrative Application when a Card is in this status. Only a Custodial Partner or Rize Team member can unlock the card. When the Card is in this status, the Card will have a locked_at value that is not null.
 * - ***closed_by_administrator*** - A Program Administrator from the Custodial Partner or the Rize Team have closed the card. Customers will have to request a new card. This will occur in rare occasions.
 * - ***shipment_returned*** - The shipped Card has been returned. An administrator must manually reissue the Card to the Customer for a new Card to be printed and shipped. This status applies only to new physical Cards; the corresponding status for replacement Cards is `card_replacement_shipment_returned`
 * - ***card_replacement_shipment_returned*** - The shipped Card has been returned. An administrator must manually reissue the Card to the Customer for a new Card to be printed and shipped. This status applies only to replacement physical Cards with the same PAN; the corresponding status for new Cards is `shipment_returned`
 * @property {boolean} ready_to_use - If the Card can be used, this value will be `true`; `false` otherwise.
 * @property {string|null} [lock_reason] - If the Card is in a locked state, this field will be populated describing why the Card was locked. Null if the Card is not locked.
 * @property {string|null} [issued_on] - The date this Card was issued. It may be briefly null when a new Card is requested, but the issuance has not yet happened (i.e. status is `initiated`).
 * @property {string|null} [locked_at] - The date and time at which this Card was locked. Null if the Card is not locked.
 * @property {string|null} [closed_at] - The date and time at which this Card was closed. This field will be null unless the `status` is `closed`, `closed_by_administrator`, `lost`, or `stolen`.
 * @property {Address|null} [latest_shipping_address]
 * An optional field used to specify the shipping address for a physical Debit Card.
 *
 * If no address was specified via `debitCard.create`, this field will be null. In case of reissuance, only the address from the latest shipment will be provided, if any.
