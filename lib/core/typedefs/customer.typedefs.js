 * @property {string} uid - A unique identifier generated by Rize
 * @property {string} external_uid - A unique identifier Client supplies. It should be given when creating a new resource and must be unique within the resource type. If the same value is given, no new resource will be created.
 * @property {string} program_uid - A uid referring to the program this customer belongs to.

 * @property {'initiated'|'queued'|'identity_verified'|'active'|'manual_review'|'rejected'|'archived'|'under_review'} status
 * A value indicating the overall state of this Customer:
 * - ***initiated*** - Rize has created the Customer as a result of a post to the Compliance Workflows endpoint. This status will persist until Rize receives a successful request to perform Identity Verification. The Customer status will move to 'queued' after a successful request to perform Identity Verification.
 * - ***queued*** - Rize has determined that the required Customer PII has been provided and the Compliance Workflow is complete. The Customer record has been sent for KYC/AML partner verification. If the KYC/AML verification returns 'approved' the Customer status will move to 'identity_verified'. If the KYC/AML verification returns 'denied' the Customer status will move to 'rejected'. If the KYC/AML verification status returns 'manual_review' the Customer status will move to 'manual_review'.
 * - ***identity_verified*** - The Customer has been approved by the KYC/AML partner's verification process. This Customer's Master Synthetic Account and Custodial Account(s) are in the process of being opened.
 * - ***active*** - The Customer has been created on the Rize platform. The default Custodial Account(s) and Master Synthetic Account for this Customer have been opened per your Program configuration.
 * - ***manual_review*** - The Customer record is under review. A Manual Review status indicates a kyc_status that is not 'approved' or 'denied'. The Status will move from 'manual_review' to either 'identity_verified' or 'rejected' depending on the outcome of the review. See the KYC_Status values for additional states pertaining to Manual Review.
 * - ***rejected*** - The Customer is not eligible for an account on this Program.
 * - ***archived*** - The Customer is archived; no actions are available for this Customer. All archived accounts have a $0.00 balance.
 * - ***under_review*** - The Customer's account balances are under review. Rize will not accept Transfer requests for this Customer until their status returns to 'active'. The Customer can continue using their Debit Card while in a status of 'under_review'. The Customer status must be 'active' before entering a status of 'under_review'. Rize will not return an 'under_review' status during any portion of creating a Customer or a Compliance Workflow.

 * - ***approved*** - The Customer has been approved by the KYC/AML partner supporting your Program. This KYC Status will prompt a change to the customer status to 'identity_verified'.
 * - ***denied*** - The Customer has been denied access by the KYC/AML partner supporting your Program. A Denied KYC Status will result in a Rejected customer status.
