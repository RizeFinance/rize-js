 * @property {string} uid - A unique identifier generated by Rize

 * @property {'initiated'|'active'|'archived'|'failed'} status
 * A value indicating the overall state of this account:
 * - ***initiated*** - The Synthetic Account is being set up and is not usable. Currently this status is only applicable to the `plaid_external` category. A `plaid_external` Synthetic Account will have the `initiated` status when created. The status will be updated to `active` when the setup is complete.
 * - ***active*** - The Synthetic Account is available for Customers to interact with. The Synthetic Account can be used in Transfers and transaction and balance inquiries.
 * - ***archived*** - The Synthetic Account is no longer available. Archived Synthetic Accounts will have a balance of $0.00.
 * - ***failed*** - The Synthetic Account setup has failed. Currently the `failed` status is only applicable to the `plaid_external` Synthetic Account category. Synthetic Accounts will start in the `initiated` status before transitioning to the `failed` status. Rize will not retry setting up Synthetic Accounts in the `failed` status and will treat them as inactive.
 * @property {boolean} liability - Liability or asset. Any Synthetic Account created via POST /synthetic_accounts is a liability account, except for external accounts. Some asset Synthetic Accounts are automatically created by Rize during Customer onboarding for accounting purposes.
 * @property {string} net_usd_balance - The current settled balance of this account in US Dollars. This field will be null for synthetic_account_types in the external category.
 * @property {string} net_usd_pending_balance - The sum of all pending transactions for this account in US Dollars. This field will be null for Synthetic Account Types in the external category.
 * @property {string} net_usd_available_balance - The balance available to spend calculated as the settled balance less any pending withdrawals Pending deposits are not included. This field will be null for Synthetic Account Types in the external category.
 * @property {boolean} master_account - Used to identify the Master Synthetic Accounts that exist for every Program Customer. Master Synthetic Accounts are the default accounts where any unknown custodial transactions will settle and cannot be archived while a Program Customer is still active.
 * @property {string | null} account_number - The ACH account number (if any) associated with this account. Some Synthetic Account Types require this field to be submitted along with the POST request. For example, any Synthetic Account Type from the `external` category will require an `account_number`.

 * @property {string | null} account_number_last_four - Last 4 digits of the ACH account number.
 * @property {string | null} routing_number - The ABA routing number (if any) associated with this account. Some Synthetic Account Types require this field to be submitted along with the POST request. For example, any Synthetic Account Type from the `external` category will require a `routing_number`.

 * @property {string} opened_at - The DateTime at which this account was created

 * @property {string | null} closed_to_synthetic_account_uid - A UID referring to the Synthetic Account where the funds in this account were transferred when closed. Any transactions issued against this account after it is closed will instead go to the `closed_to` account
