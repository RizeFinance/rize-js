Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;void>** A promise that returns void if resolved.

### verifyIdentity

Submit a request for Identity Verification

The Identity Verification of a customer serves as explicit confirmation from you that the Customer is ready for account opening.
This event initiates the KYC/AML verification process and account opening at the Custodian(s) in your Program.
This is a billable event and is isolated intentionally for you to confirm that the Customer record is complete.

Identity Verification is the event that locks the customer PII from further edits.

Identity Verification is designed to work as follows:

-   The Customer completes the Compliance Workflow initiated from the Compliance Workflows endpoint and all documents are acknowledged.
-   The Customer provides complete PII as defined by the Customers endpoint
-   You submit a request to Identity Verification
-   Rize performs a validation on the PII provided and the Compliance Workflow to confirm both are valid.
-   If the Customer passes these validations and meets the duration requirements described below, the Customer record is submitted to the KYC process.

Duration Requirements:

You have a set duration to submit to Identity Verification for a Customer.
Rize measures the duration from the begun_at timestamp of the current Compliance Workflow returned from the Compliance Workflows endpoint to the time Rize receives the Identity Verification request.

If the Identity Verification request falls outside of the set duration, your request will fail.
If your request fails, a new Compliance Workflow must be started for this Customer.
This will restart the duration available for a valid submission to Identity Verification.

The previously submitted Customer PII remains editable for this customer after a failed submission to Identity Verification.

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][206]** Rize-generated unique customer id.

#### Examples

```javascript
const updatedCustomer = await rize.customer.verifyIdentity(customerUid);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[Customer][214]>** A promise that returns the updated Customer if resolved.

### lock

Lock a Customer 

This will freeze all activities relating to the Customer. This means, until the customer is unlocked:

-   No personal information can be edited
-   The Customer cannot be archived
-   Any pending enrollment requests are paused or withdrawn
-   Any transfers requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any transfers already in progress when the lock is put in place will be stopped and reversed
-   (not implemented) Any debit card transactions requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any Pool in which this Customer is a member will similarly be locked
-   The Customer's transfers, transactions, account details, or any other information are still readable

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][206]** Rize-generated unique customer id
-   `lockReason` **[string][206]** The reason that the Customer is being locked must be submitted with the request body.

#### Examples

```javascript
const customer = await rize.customer.lock(customerUid, lockReason);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[Customer][214]>** A promise that returns the locked Customer if resolved.

### unlock

Unlock a Customer 

This will remove the Customer lock, returning their state to normal.
Note that if the Customer was locked by a Custodial Partner or Rize admin
or by an automated system such as fraud transaction monitoring, 
the Client cannot unlock the Customer from either the API or the Admin UI.
If the Customer was locked by the Client either via API or Admin UI,
the unlock can be performed by the Custodial Partner, the Client, or Rize.

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][206]** Rize-generated unique customer id
-   `unlockReason` **[string][206]** The reason that the Customer is being unlocked. (optional, default `null`)

#### Examples

```javascript
const customer = await rize.customer.unlock(customerUid, unlockReason);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[Customer][214]>** A promise that returns the unlocked Customer if resolved.

## DebitCardService

The Debit Card service class

### getList

Retrieves a list of Debit Cards filtered by the given parameters.

#### Parameters

-   `query` **[DebitCardListQuery][216]?** An object containing key value pair for filtering the results list. (optional, default `{}`)

#### Examples

```javascript
const debitCards = await rize.debitCard.getList({
    customer_uid: ['customer_uid1', 'customer_uid2'],
    external_uid: 'external_uid1',
    limit: 50,
    offset: 0,
    pool_uid: ['pool_uid1', 'pool_uid2'],
    locked: false,
    status: ['queued', 'issued']
});
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[RizeList][212]&lt;[DebitCard][217]>>** A promise that returns a Debit Card List if resolved.

### get

Get a single Debit Card

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][206]** Rize-generated unique debitCard id

#### Examples

```javascript
const debitCard = await rize.debitCard.get(debitCardUid);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[DebitCard][217]>** A promise that returns a Debit Card if resolved.

### create

Create a new Debit Card and attach it to the supplied Customer and Pool. The Synthetic and Custodial Accounts that 
belong to the new Card will be automatically determined.

The physical Debit Card will be sent to the Customer's primary address, set via the `customer.update` function, 
by default. If the Card needs to be shipped to a different address, the address can be specified in the `shipping_address` 
field. Once the Client submits the create Debit Card request, the shipping address cannot be changed.

When a Debit Card creation is successfully requested, the Card will be in the `queued` state. After the Custodial Partner 
issues the new card, it will move on to the `issued` state. When the new Debit Card is being produced, the card will be in 
the `printing_physical_card state`. After the Debit Card is produced it will be `shipped` to the Customer. When the Debit 
Card is shipped, the card will be in the shipped state.

When the Customer has received their Debit Card, they will need to set their PIN via IVR (Interactive Voice Response). 
After the Customer succesfully sets the PIN, the Custodial Partner will notify Rize via call back and Rize will update 
the state in the system to `normal`.

#### Parameters

-   `externalUid` **[string][206]** A unique identifier Client supplies. It should be given when creating a new resource and must be unique within the resource type. If the same value is given, no new resource will be created.
-   `customerUid` **[string][206]** A UID referring to the Customer who owns this Card
-   `poolUid` **[string][206]** A UID referring to the Pool to which this Card belongs
-   `shippingAddress` **([Address][218] | null)?** An optional field used to specify the shipping address for a physical Debit Card.Either the whole `address` must be nullable or all fields must be provided, with an except of `street2`, which is nullable.If no address is specified, the primary address associated with the customer will be used as a shipping address. (optional, default `null`)

#### Examples

```javascript
const debitCard = await rize.debitCard.create(
    'partner-generated-id',
    'customer_uid1',
    'pool_uid1',
    {
        street1: '123 Abc St.',
        street2: 'Apt 2',
        city: 'Chicago',
        state: 'IL',
        postal_code: '12345'
    }
);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[DebitCard][217]>** A promise that returns a Debit Card if resolved.

### lock

Lock a Debit Card

A Debit Card can be locked temporarily by either the Customer, Client, or the Custodial Partner. 
A lock is only temporary and can generally be removed by calling `debitCard.unlock`.

    'debit_card_uid1',
    'Fraud detected'
);
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[DebitCard][217]>** A promise that returns a Debit Card if resolved.

### unlock

Unlock a Debit Card

Calling this function will attempt to remove a lock placed on a Debit Card. 
Depending on the type of lock in place, this will not always be successful. 
For example, a lock placed by a Custodial Partner for fraud can not be removed by a Customer.

Reissue a Debit Card

Reissuance may be requested when a Debit Card is lost or stolen, or when it has suffered damage. 
In the case of a damaged Debit Card, the original remains usable while the reissued card is being processed. 
The reissued card will have the same PAN as the original and the Debit Card UID will not change.

When a reissued Debit Card is requested because the original was lost or stolen, the original card is closed 
and the reissued card will have a new PAN. For Debit Cards reported lost or stolen, a new Debit Card UID will 
be provided by Rize to identify the reissued Debit Card.

The new physical Debit Card will by default be sent to the Customer's primary address, set via `customer.update`.

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][206]** Rize-generated unique Debit Card id
-   `reissueReason` **(`"damaged"` \| `"lost"` \| `"stolen"`)** A reissue reason is required when requesting Debit Card reissuance.

#### Examples

```javascript
const reissuedDebitCard = await rize.debitCard.reissue('debit_card_uid1', 'damaged');
```

Returns **[Promise][207]&lt;[DebitCard][217]>** A promise that returns a Debit Card if resolved.

### complianceWorkflow

The Compliance Workflow is where you begin onboarding Customers to your Program.
Compliance Workflows are used to group all of the required Compliance Documents together and to ensure they are presented and acknowledged in the correct order.

Type: [ComplianceWorkflowService][245]

### customer

A Customer on the Rize Platform is the end user of your application.
Customers are unique to each Program and the management of all accounts and identifying information is handled on a Program-by-Program basis.

Type: [CustomerService][246]

### syntheticAccount

Synthetic Accounts are what your application will build around and your Customers will interact with.
Synthetic Accounts are designed to track any asset types, for any Customers, at any Custodian.

Type: [SyntheticAccountService][247]

### custodialAccount

Custodial Account is the account held by the Custodian participating in your Program. Custodial Accounts in a Program can only be created for the Service Offerings that have been configured for that Program.
A Customer must successfully complete onboarding and pass all KYC/AML checks before their Custodial Accounts can be opened.

Type: [CustodialAccountService][248]

### transaction

Transactions are created based on how you instruct Rize to move assets (a Transfer) or how assets are 
moved or spent outside of your application (ATM withdrawals, debit card purchase, wire transfers, etc…). 
The Transaction contains the amount, origin, and destination of assets. Rize categorizes Transactions 
into types to assist in their classification and representation.

Transactions fall into many categories, including debit card purchases, direct deposits, interest, and 
fees. This endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of Transactions or track the status of an ongoing Transaction.

Transaction Events are created as a result of a Transaction. They capture the steps required to complete the Transaction. 
These can be used to view the progress of an in-flight Transaction or see the history of a completed Transaction.

Line Items are created for each Transaction Event. 
They catalogue the individual credits and debits associated with the accounts involved in the Transaction.

Type: [TransactionService][249]

### transfer

A Transfer is the action of moving assets between any two Synthetic Accounts. The majority of asset movement 
initiated by your application will result in a Transfer. Asset movement is determined by the makeup of assets 
in both participating accounts, the Synthetic Account Type of each account, the available Custodial Accounts 
for all participating Customers, as well as the overall Program configuration. A Transfer can never be initiated 
between two external accounts.

Transfers can be initiated between most combinations of Synthetic Account Types. Due to the time required to 
complete ACH transfers or trades of assets in underlying Custodial Accounts, it is possible for a Transfer to 
take up to 6 business days to settle in the most extreme cases (such as starting with a stock sale and completing 
in a checking account deposit at a different financial institution).

Type: [TransferService][250]

### debitCard

Debit Cards allow a Customer direct access to their funds via Point of Sale and ATM transactions. Each Debit Card is tied 
to a single Custodial Account and a single Synthetic Account which determines where transactions associated with the Debit 
Card will be settled.

This endpoint supports debit card management, such as requesting a card, activating a card, reporting a card lost or stolen, 
and locking and unlocking a debit card. The Custodian participating in your Program will define some characteristics of the 
card (maximum transaction limits, international usage, etc.) and these will be configured and communicated to you as part of 
the Program configuration.

Certain information about a Debit Card (such as the PAN, PIN, and CVV) are considered highly sensitive and are subject to 
strict PCI compliance requirements. As such, the process for issuing and verifying a card is a multi-step process that can 
only be completed by the Customer. At no time will the PCI restricted data be made available to either you or Rize. The last 
4 digits of the Debit Card PAN and/or a unique card nickname can be used to identify the card to the Customer.

### document

All Customers will be able to access their monthly account statements and their yearly tax documents as they become available
at the end of the respective periods. The document resource returned in `document.getList` and `document.get` will describe
the metadata of the document, such as its document type and the document period. `document.view` can be used to receive the document in PDF by default. 
The document can also be returned in JSON or HTML format using `document.view(uid, 'html)` or `document.view(uid, 'json)`, respectively.

The document type specifies whether the document is a statement or tax document.

Please note that only the settled transactions will appear in the statement i.e. if a transaction is initiated before a settlement 
period ends and settles after the new period starts, it will appear in the statement for the latter period.

Type: [DocumentService][251]

### kycDocument

The KYC Documents endpoint enables Customers to upload identity verification documentation. These documents are only required
if Rize’s KYC/AML partner is unable to confirm the identity of the Customer with the information provided during onboarding.

A KYC Document is a file that is uploaded which a reviewer can use to inform a decision as to whether this Customer should be approved
or denied for the Program. These files are generally utility bills or images of state issued driver’s licenses.
