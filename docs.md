### verifyIdentity

Submit a request for Identity Verification

The Identity Verification of a customer serves as explicit confirmation from you that the Customer is ready for account opening.
This event initiates the KYC/AML verification process and account opening at the Custodian(s) in your Program.
This is a billable event and is isolated intentionally for you to confirm that the Customer record is complete.

Identity Verification is the event that locks the customer PII from further edits.

Identity Verification is designed to work as follows:

-   The Customer completes the Compliance Workflow initiated from the Compliance Workflows endpoint and all documents are acknowledged.
-   The Customer provides complete PII as defined by the Customers endpoint
-   You submit a request to Identity Verification
-   Rize performs a validation on the PII provided and the Compliance Workflow to confirm both are valid.
-   If the Customer passes these validations and meets the duration requirements described below, the Customer record is submitted to the KYC process.

Duration Requirements:

You have a set duration to submit to Identity Verification for a Customer.
Rize measures the duration from the begun_at timestamp of the current Compliance Workflow returned from the Compliance Workflows endpoint to the time Rize receives the Identity Verification request.

If the Identity Verification request falls outside of the set duration, your request will fail.
If your request fails, a new Compliance Workflow must be started for this Customer.
This will restart the duration available for a valid submission to Identity Verification.

The previously submitted Customer PII remains editable for this customer after a failed submission to Identity Verification.

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][162]** Rize-generated unique customer id.

#### Examples

```javascript
const updatedCustomer = await rize.customer.verifyIdentity(customerUid);
```

Returns **[Promise][163]&lt;[Customer][170]>** A promise that returns the updated Customer if resolved.

### lock

Lock a Customer 

This will freeze all activities relating to the Customer. This means, until the customer is unlocked:

-   No personal information can be edited
-   The Customer cannot be archived
-   Any pending enrollment requests are paused or withdrawn
-   Any transfers requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any transfers already in progress when the lock is put in place will be stopped and reversed
-   (not implemented) Any debit card transactions requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any Pool in which this Customer is a member will similarly be locked
-   The Customer's transfers, transactions, account details, or any other information are still readable

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][162]** Rize-generated unique customer id
-   `lockReason` **[string][162]** The reason that the Customer is being locked must be submitted with the request body.

#### Examples

```javascript
const customer = await rize.customer.lock(customerUid, lockReason);
```

Returns **[Promise][163]&lt;[Customer][170]>** A promise that returns the locked Customer if resolved.

### unlock

Unlock a Customer 

This will remove the Customer lock, returning their state to normal.
Note that if the Customer was locked by a Custodial Partner or Rize admin
or by an automated system such as fraud transaction monitoring, 
the Client cannot unlock the Customer from either the API or the Admin UI.
If the Customer was locked by the Client either via API or Admin UI,
the unlock can be performed by the Custodial Partner, the Client, or Rize.

#### Parameters

-   `status` **(`"queued"` \| `"pending"` \| `"settled"` \| `"failed"`)** When a Transfer is created via `transfers.init()`, an associated Transaction is created with queued status. 
    If it involves at least one custodial transfer, once the custodial transfer is initiated, the status will transition to pending.Once a Transaction is settled, whether it has asset movement in custodial level, or is synthetic-only, or is RDFI (no Transfer associated), it will have a settled status.-   **_queued_** - The Transaction is being prepared as a result of a Transfer request. Transactions that originate outside of Rize (e.g., debit card transactions, RDFI ACHs, direct deposits, etc.) will not be given this status.
    -   **_pending_** - The Transaction is being processed. This state will persist until all related Transaction Events have settled or could not be completed.
    -   **_settled_** - The Transaction is complete. All of the related Transaction Events are settled.
    -   **_failed_** - The Transaction has failed. This state indicates that one of the related Transaction Events could not be settled. A failed Transaction may require the reversal of a related Synthetic Line Item and/or Custodial Line Item.
-   `us_dollar_amount` **[string][162]** The amount will never be negative
-   `type` **(`"atm_withdrawal"` \| `"card_purchase"` \| `"card_refund"` \| `"dispute"` \| `"external_transfer"` \| `"fee"` \| `"internal_transfer"` \| `"other"` \| `"reversed_transfer"` \| `"third_party_transfer"`)** **_atm_withdrawal_** - Cash is withdrawn at an ATM using a Debit Card.-   **_card_purchase_** - A purchase is made using a Debit Card.

### complianceWorkflow

The Compliance Workflow is where you begin onboarding Customers to your Program.
Compliance Workflows are used to group all of the required Compliance Documents together and to ensure they are presented and acknowledged in the correct order.

Type: [ComplianceWorkflowService][196]

### customer

A Customer on the Rize Platform is the end user of your application.
Customers are unique to each Program and the management of all accounts and identifying information is handled on a Program-by-Program basis.

Type: [CustomerService][197]

### syntheticAccount

Synthetic Accounts are what your application will build around and your Customers will interact with.
Synthetic Accounts are designed to track any asset types, for any Customers, at any Custodian.

Type: [SyntheticAccountService][198]

### custodialAccount

Custodial Account is the account held by the Custodian participating in your Program. Custodial Accounts in a Program can only be created for the Service Offerings that have been configured for that Program.
A Customer must successfully complete onboarding and pass all KYC/AML checks before their Custodial Accounts can be opened.

Type: [CustodialAccountService][199]

### transaction

Transactions are created based on how you instruct Rize to move assets (a Transfer) or how assets are 
moved or spent outside of your application (ATM withdrawals, debit card purchase, wire transfers, etc…). 
The Transaction contains the amount, origin, and destination of assets. Rize categorizes Transactions 
into types to assist in their classification and representation.

Transactions fall into many categories, including debit card purchases, direct deposits, interest, and 
fees. This endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of Transactions or track the status of an ongoing Transaction.

Transaction Events are created as a result of a Transaction. They capture the steps required to complete the Transaction. 
These can be used to view the progress of an in-flight Transaction or see the history of a completed Transaction.

Line Items are created for each Transaction Event. 
They catalogue the individual credits and debits associated with the accounts involved in the Transaction.

Type: [TransactionService][200]

### transfer

A Transfer is the action of moving assets between any two Synthetic Accounts. The majority of asset movement 
initiated by your application will result in a Transfer. Asset movement is determined by the makeup of assets 
in both participating accounts, the Synthetic Account Type of each account, the available Custodial Accounts 
for all participating Customers, as well as the overall Program configuration. A Transfer can never be initiated 
between two external accounts.

Transfers can be initiated between most combinations of Synthetic Account Types. Due to the time required to 
complete ACH transfers or trades of assets in underlying Custodial Accounts, it is possible for a Transfer to 
take up to 6 business days to settle in the most extreme cases (such as starting with a stock sale and completing 
in a checking account deposit at a different financial institution).
