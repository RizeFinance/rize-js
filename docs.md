### verifyIdentity

Submit a request for Identity Verification

The Identity Verification of a customer serves as explicit confirmation from you that the Customer is ready for account opening.
This event initiates the KYC/AML verification process and account opening at the Custodian(s) in your Program.
This is a billable event and is isolated intentionally for you to confirm that the Customer record is complete.

Identity Verification is the event that locks the customer PII from further edits.

Identity Verification is designed to work as follows:

-   The Customer completes the Compliance Workflow initiated from the Compliance Workflows endpoint and all documents are acknowledged.
-   The Customer provides complete PII as defined by the Customers endpoint
-   You submit a request to Identity Verification
-   Rize performs a validation on the PII provided and the Compliance Workflow to confirm both are valid.
-   If the Customer passes these validations and meets the duration requirements described below, the Customer record is submitted to the KYC process.

Duration Requirements:

You have a set duration to submit to Identity Verification for a Customer.
Rize measures the duration from the begun_at timestamp of the current Compliance Workflow returned from the Compliance Workflows endpoint to the time Rize receives the Identity Verification request.

If the Identity Verification request falls outside of the set duration, your request will fail.
If your request fails, a new Compliance Workflow must be started for this Customer.
This will restart the duration available for a valid submission to Identity Verification.

The previously submitted Customer PII remains editable for this customer after a failed submission to Identity Verification.

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][108]** Rize-generated unique customer id.

#### Examples

```javascript
const updatedCustomer = await rize.customer.verifyIdentity(customerUid);
```

Returns **[Promise][109]&lt;[Customer][116]>** A promise that returns the updated Customer if resolved.

### lock

Lock a Customer 

This will freeze all activities relating to the Customer. This means, until the customer is unlocked:

-   No personal information can be edited
-   The Customer cannot be archived
-   Any pending enrollment requests are paused or withdrawn
-   Any transfers requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any transfers already in progress when the lock is put in place will be stopped and reversed
-   (not implemented) Any debit card transactions requested after the lock is in place will be rejected
-   (not implemented) Any Pool in which this Customer is a member will similarly be locked
-   The Customer's transfers, transactions, account details, or any other information are still readable

#### Parameters

-   `uid` **[string][108]** Rize-generated unique customer id
-   `lockReason` **[string][108]** The reason that the Customer is being locked must be submitted with the request body.

#### Examples

const customer = await rize.customer.lock(customerUid, lockReason);
```

Returns **[Promise][109]&lt;[Customer][116]>** A promise that returns the locked Customer if resolved.

### unlock

Unlock a Customer 

This will remove the Customer lock, returning their state to normal.
Note that if the Customer was locked by a Custodial Partner or Rize admin
or by an automated system such as fraud transaction monitoring, 
the Client cannot unlock the Customer from either the API or the Admin UI.
If the Customer was locked by the Client either via API or Admin UI,
the unlock can be performed by the Custodial Partner, the Client, or Rize.
