const debitCards = await rize.debitCard.getList({
    customer_uid: ['customer_uid1', 'customer_uid2'],
    external_uid: 'external_uid1',
    limit: 50,
    offset: 0,
    pool_uid: ['pool_uid1', 'pool_uid2'],

    status: ['queued', 'issued']
});
```

```

Returns **[Promise][308]&lt;[DebitCard][321]>** A promise that returns a Debit Card if resolved.

### create

Create a new Debit Card and attach it to the supplied Customer and Pool. The Synthetic and Custodial Accounts that 
belong to the new Card will be automatically determined.

The physical Debit Card will be sent to the Customer's primary address, set via the `customer.update` function, 
by default. If the Card needs to be shipped to a different address, the address can be specified in the `shipping_address` 
field. Once the Client submits the create Debit Card request, the shipping address cannot be changed.

When a Debit Card creation is successfully requested, the Card will be in the `queued` state. After the Custodial Partner 
issues the new card, it will move on to the `issued` state. When the new Debit Card is being produced, the card will be in 
the `printing_physical_card state`. After the Debit Card is produced it will be `shipped` to the Customer. When the Debit 
Card is shipped, the card will be in the shipped state.

When the Customer has received their Debit Card, they will need to set their PIN via IVR (Interactive Voice Response). 
After the Customer succesfully sets the PIN, the Custodial Partner will notify Rize via call back and Rize will update 
the state in the system to `normal`.

#### Parameters

-   `externalUid` **[string][307]** A unique identifier Client supplies. It should be given when creating a new resource and must be unique within the resource type. If the same value is given, no new resource will be created.
-   `customerUid` **[string][307]** A UID referring to the Customer who owns this Card
-   `poolUid` **[string][307]** A UID referring to the Pool to which this Card belongs
-   `shippingAddress` **([Address][322] | null)?** An optional field used to specify the shipping address for a physical Debit Card.Either the whole `address` must be nullable or all fields must be provided, with an except of `street2`, which is nullable.If no address is specified, the primary address associated with the customer will be used as a shipping address. (optional, default `null`)

#### Examples

```javascript
const debitCard = await rize.debitCard.create(
    'partner-generated-id',
    'customer_uid1',
    'pool_uid1',
    {
        street1: '123 Abc St.',

### reissue

Reissue a Debit Card

Reissuance may be requested when a Debit Card is lost or stolen, or when it has suffered damage. 
In the case of a damaged Debit Card, the original remains usable while the reissued card is being processed. 
The reissued card will have the same PAN as the original and the Debit Card UID will not change.

When a reissued Debit Card is requested because the original was lost or stolen, the original card is closed 
and the reissued card will have a new PAN. For Debit Cards reported lost or stolen, a new Debit Card UID will 
be provided by Rize to identify the reissued Debit Card.

The new physical Debit Card will by default be sent to the Customer's primary address, set via `customer.update`.

## RizeMessageQueueConnectOptions

Type: [Object][348]

### Properties

-   `environment` **(`"sandbox"` \| `"integration"` \| `"production"`)?** 
-   `maxReconnects` **[number][349]?** 

## RizeMessageQueueClient

**Extends Stomp.Channel**

The RizeMessageQueueClient class

### subscribeToRizeTopic

Creates a durable Rize Message Queue topic subscription

#### Parameters

-   `topicSubject` **(`"customer"` \| `"debit_card"` \| `"synthetic_account"` \| `"synthetic_account"` \| `"transfer"` \| `"transaction"`)** The subject of the Topic to subscribe to
-   `subscriptionName` **[string][307]** Assign a name for the subscription
-   `messageListener` **[messageListener][359]** The event message listener
-   `ackHeader` **(`"client"` \| `"client-individual"` \| `"auto"`)?** (Default=`'client'`)When the ack mode is `'client'`, then the client MUST use the `ack` function that was passed to the `messageListener` 
    to send the server ACK frames for the messages it processes.
    If the connection fails before a client sends an ACK frame for the message, the server will assume the message has not been processed 
    and MAY redeliver the message to another client. The ACK frames sent by the client will be treated as a cumulative acknowledgment. 
    This means the acknowledgment operates on the message specified in the ACK frame and all messages sent to the subscription before 
    the ACK'ed message.In case the client did not process some messages, it SHOULD use the `nack` function that was passed to the `messageListener` 
    to send NACK frames to tell the server it did not consume these messages.When the ack mode is `'client-individual'`, the acknowledgment operates just like the client acknowledgment mode except that the 
    ACK or NACK frames sent by the client are not cumulative. This means that an ACK or NACK frame for a subsequent message MUST NOT cause a 
    previous message to get acknowledged.When the ack mode is `'auto'`, then the client does not need to send the server ACK frames for the messages it receives. The server will 
    assume the client has received the message as soon as it sends it to the client. This acknowledgment mode can cause messages being 
    transmitted to the client to get dropped. (optional, default `'client'`)

### complianceWorkflow

The Compliance Workflow is where you begin onboarding Customers to your Program.
Compliance Workflows are used to group all of the required Compliance Documents together and to ensure they are presented and acknowledged in the correct order.

Type: [ComplianceWorkflowService][367]

### customer

Customer Product records are generated when a Customer is submitted for onboarding to a specific Product.

Clients will POST when a Customer has fulfilled the prerequisite Product requirements.
Rize will then verify that the Product requirements have been met. If the Product requirements are met,
Rize will proceed with account opening and feature enablement as specified by the Product.

If the Product requirements are not met, Rize will return an error response indicating what element of the Product validation failed.

Type: [CustomerProductService][368]

### customerProduct

A Customer on the Rize Platform is the end user of your application.
Customers are unique to each Program and the management of all accounts and identifying information is handled on a Program-by-Program basis.

Type: [CustomerService][369]

### syntheticAccount

Synthetic Accounts are what your application will build around and your Customers will interact with.
Synthetic Accounts are designed to track any asset types, for any Customers, at any Custodian.

Type: [SyntheticAccountService][370]

### custodialAccount

Custodial Account is the account held by the Custodian participating in your Program. Custodial Accounts in a Program can only be created for the Service Offerings that have been configured for that Program.
A Customer must successfully complete onboarding and pass all KYC/AML checks before their Custodial Accounts can be opened.

Type: [CustodialAccountService][371]

### transaction

Transactions are created based on how you instruct Rize to move assets (a Transfer) or how assets are 
moved or spent outside of your application (ATM withdrawals, debit card purchase, wire transfers, etc…). 
The Transaction contains the amount, origin, and destination of assets. Rize categorizes Transactions 
into types to assist in their classification and representation.

Transactions fall into many categories, including debit card purchases, direct deposits, interest, and 
fees. This endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of Transactions or track the status of an ongoing Transaction.

Transaction Events are created as a result of a Transaction. They capture the steps required to complete the Transaction. 
These can be used to view the progress of an in-flight Transaction or see the history of a completed Transaction.

Line Items are created for each Transaction Event. 
They catalogue the individual credits and debits associated with the accounts involved in the Transaction.

Type: [TransactionService][372]

### transfer

A Transfer is the action of moving assets between any two Synthetic Accounts. The majority of asset movement 
initiated by your application will result in a Transfer. Asset movement is determined by the makeup of assets 
in both participating accounts, the Synthetic Account Type of each account, the available Custodial Accounts 
for all participating Customers, as well as the overall Program configuration. A Transfer can never be initiated 
between two external accounts.

Transfers can be initiated between most combinations of Synthetic Account Types. Due to the time required to 
complete ACH transfers or trades of assets in underlying Custodial Accounts, it is possible for a Transfer to 
take up to 6 business days to settle in the most extreme cases (such as starting with a stock sale and completing 
in a checking account deposit at a different financial institution).

Type: [TransferService][373]

### debitCard

Debit Cards allow a Customer direct access to their funds via Point of Sale and ATM transactions. Each Debit Card is tied 
to a single Custodial Account and a single Synthetic Account which determines where transactions associated with the Debit 
Card will be settled.

This endpoint supports debit card management, such as requesting a card, activating a card, reporting a card lost or stolen, 
and locking and unlocking a debit card. The Custodian participating in your Program will define some characteristics of the 
card (maximum transaction limits, international usage, etc.) and these will be configured and communicated to you as part of 
the Program configuration.

Certain information about a Debit Card (such as the PAN, PIN, and CVV) are considered highly sensitive and are subject to 
strict PCI compliance requirements. As such, the process for issuing and verifying a card is a multi-step process that can 
only be completed by the Customer. At no time will the PCI restricted data be made available to either you or Rize. The last 
4 digits of the Debit Card PAN and/or a unique card nickname can be used to identify the card to the Customer.

Type: [DebitCardService][374]

### document

All Customers will be able to access their monthly account statements and their yearly tax documents as they become available
at the end of the respective periods. The document resource returned in `document.getList` and `document.get` will describe
the metadata of the document, such as its document type and the document period. `document.view` can be used to receive the document in PDF by default. 
The document can also be returned in JSON or HTML format using `document.view(uid, 'html)` or `document.view(uid, 'json)`, respectively.

The document type specifies whether the document is a statement or tax document.

Please note that only the settled transactions will appear in the statement i.e. if a transaction is initiated before a settlement 
period ends and settles after the new period starts, it will appear in the statement for the latter period.

Type: [DocumentService][375]

### kycDocument

The KYC Documents endpoint enables Customers to upload identity verification documentation. These documents are only required
if Rize’s KYC/AML partner is unable to confirm the identity of the Customer with the information provided during onboarding.

A KYC Document is a file that is uploaded which a reviewer can use to inform a decision as to whether this Customer should be approved
or denied for the Program. These files are generally utility bills or images of state issued driver’s licenses.

Type: [KYCDocumentService][376]

### evaluation

An Evaluation is the result of submitting a customer's personal details to one of Rize's KYC partners. If Customer PII is updated,
another Evaluation is generated with its own unique Evaluation identifier.

Type: [EvaluationService][377]

### pool

A Pool is a construct Rize uses to associate multiple Customers to each other. A Pool is always associated with at least one Customer, 
but all accounts are only ever associated with a single Pool. This enables asset sharing and distributed ownership of accounts across 
multiple Customers.

Rize currently supports single Customer Pools, where one Customer is associated to one Pool and vice versa. All accounts, transfers, 
and transactions are associated with the Customer’s Pool, not the Customer. The Pool UID appears on several endpoint responses and may 
be required by the API in some instances.

Multi-Customer Pools is a beta product - contact us at hello@rizemoney.com for more information on how to build with joint accounts 
involving multiple Customers and multiple Pools. A multi-Customer Pool represents a group of Customers within a Program that have 
elected to share assets with each other. All assets within a Pool are shared by all members of the Pool, but the initial creator of 
the Pool is designated as the owner of both the Pool itself and all Custodial Accounts that are created for the Pool.

Type: [PoolService][378]

### product

Products contain the specific group of features, accounts, and requirements necessary to make a Product available to your Customers.
Use getList to view the Products available to your Program as well as the prerequisite information or actions that must be taken for a Customer to access the Product.
multiple Customers.

Type: [ProductService][379]
